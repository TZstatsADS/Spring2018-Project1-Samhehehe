### [Project summary](doc/)

For this project, we firstly created two data summary tables of the words of inaugural speeches for the Democratic and the Republican party respectively. Simultaneously, two plots, respectively showing the first and the second inaugural speech of presidents, are also drew to demonstrate how the words of inaugural speeches changed through years. By comparing with the two parties, it can be found that most of the Republican's inaugural speeches have more words than that of the Democratic during the same period of time, especially for the first inaugural speech of each president. Then, an interactive word cloud is created to see the difference of the texts those speeches between two parties. The comparison shows the Republican tends to talk more about economics and business. However, the Democratic is apt to discuss more about the unity of the people and human rights.
